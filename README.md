Python Programming with the following tasks:

1) Creating an Alarm Clock:
   The Python program for creating an alarm clock allows users to set an alarm time and select an alarm sound. The program uses the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can input the alarm time and choose the sound file. The application runs in the background, continuously checking the current time. When the current time matches the set alarm time, the selected sound file is played, acting as an alarm to wake up or signal an event.

2) OTP Verification:
   The Python program for OTP verification implements a simple OTP generation and verification system using the Tkinter library for the GUI and the `smtplib` library to send OTPs via email. Users provide their email address for OTP verification. The program generates a random 6-digit OTP, sends it to the specified email address, and prompts the user to input the received OTP. If the user's input matches the generated OTP, the program displays a success message indicating successful verification; otherwise, an error message is shown.

3) URL Shortener with API:
   The Python program for URL shortening uses the library and integrates with a URL shortening API to generate shortened URLs. Users can enter a long URL in the application's input field and click a "Shorten" button. The program sends the long URL to the API, which processes it and returns a shortened version. The shortened URL is then displayed to the user, making it easier to share long URLs with others and track link clicks.
